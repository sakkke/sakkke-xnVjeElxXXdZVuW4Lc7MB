## :smile: Hi!

I'm Konosuke, a student developer.
I love open source software!
I'm one of the port maintainers of [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).
I'm currently creating [xi](https://github.com/sakkke/xi), a Debian-based Linux distro inspired by Windows 11.
You can download [xi.iso](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ro9m4bdk7k8drk4/xi.iso?dl=1) directly (powered by [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), thanks!).
xi installation is in [the xi documentation](https://github.com/sakkke/xi).

Above is a screenshot of the development in progress.
I plan to add some minimum required features!
