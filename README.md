こんにちは！

Hello!
I'm Konosuke!
I like [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (a theme), [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) (a programming language), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (a command), and languages.
My dream is bringing computers to everyone, so I'm currently creating an Arch Linux distro [Flight OS](https://github.com/sakkke/flightos).
