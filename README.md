こんにちは！
幸乃介です！
[Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)（テーマ）と、[V](https://github.com/vlang/v)（プログラミング言語）と、[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)（コマンド）と、言語が好きです。
僕の夢はすべての人にコンピュータを届けることです。
そのため、現在 Arch Linux ディストロ [Flight OS](https://github.com/sakkke/flightos) をつくっています。

Hello!
I'm Konosuke!
I like [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (a theme), [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) (a programming language), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (a command), and languages.
My dream is bringing computers to everyone, so I'm currently creating an Arch Linux distro [Flight OS](https://github.com/sakkke/flightos).
