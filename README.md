I'm Konosuke.
I'm a student developer.
I love open source softwares and projects!
I'm one of the port maintainers of [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/).
In Catppuccin flavours, I love Macchiato especially.
Pastel colors are awesome! 🐱

### :bird: Operating System Freedoms for All

This is [xi](https://github.com/sakkke/xi).
It's a Debian-based Linux distro inspired by Windows 11.
You can download [xi.iso](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ro9m4bdk7k8drk4/xi.iso?dl=1) directly (powered by [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), thanks!).
xi features and installation is in [the xi documentation](https://github.com/sakkke/xi).

I plan to add some more features!
